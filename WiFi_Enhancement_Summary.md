# ESP32-CAM WiFi Enhancement Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the ESP32-CAM project to display WiFi connection speed and protocol information on the web interface.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added WiFi Detection Functions (`webserver.h` & `webserver.cpp`)
- **`getWiFiProtocol()`**: Detects WiFi protocol (802.11b/g/n) based on channel and signal strength
- **`getWiFiBandwidth()`**: Determines channel bandwidth (20MHz, 22MHz for legacy, HT20 for 802.11n)
- **`getWiFiConnectionSpeed()`**: Estimates connection speed based on protocol, bandwidth, and RSSI

### 2. Protocol Detection Logic
- **802.11n (2.4GHz)**: Most common for ESP32, supports up to 72 Mbps (HT20) or 150 Mbps (HT40)
- **802.11g**: Legacy support, up to 54 Mbps
- **802.11b**: Oldest standard, up to 11 Mbps
- Uses RSSI-based estimation for realistic speed ranges

### 3. JSON API Enhancement
Updated `/status` endpoint to include:
```json
{
  "wifi": {
    "protocol": "802.11n (2.4GHz)",
    "speed": "72 Mbps (MCS7, HT20)",
    "bandwidth": "20MHz (HT20)"
  }
}
```

### 4. Web Interface Updates
- Added 3 new info cards in the WiFi settings grid:
  - **WiFi Protocol**: Shows detected 802.11 standard
  - **Connection Speed**: Shows estimated link rate with modulation details
  - **Channel Bandwidth**: Shows channel width information
- Updated CSS grid to be responsive with `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr))`

### 5. JavaScript Enhancement
- Updated `loadWiFiInfo()` function to fetch and display new WiFi data
- Added fallback "Unknown" values for error handling

### 6. Serial Output Enhancement
- Added channel information to WiFi connection debug output

## Technical Details

### ESP32 WiFi Capabilities
- ESP32 classic supports 802.11 b/g/n on 2.4GHz only
- Single spatial stream (1x1 MIMO)
- Maximum theoretical: 150 Mbps (40MHz) or 72 Mbps (20MHz)

### Detection Method
Since Arduino ESP32 core doesn't expose negotiated link rates directly:
1. Uses channel detection and RSSI analysis
2. Makes educated assumptions based on signal quality
3. Provides theoretical speeds with modulation coding scheme (MCS) information

### Speed Estimation Examples
- **Strong signal (-50 dBm)**: Full MCS rates (72 Mbps for HT20)
- **Good signal (-60 dBm)**: High MCS rates (65 Mbps for HT20)
- **Weak signal (-70+ dBm)**: Lower MCS rates or legacy fallback

## Files Modified
1. `/src/modules/webserver.h` - Added function declarations
2. `/src/modules/webserver.cpp` - Implemented detection functions and web UI
3. `/src/main.cpp` - Added channel info to serial output

## Build Status
✅ Successfully compiled with PlatformIO
✅ Memory usage: RAM 15.2%, Flash 28.8%
✅ All dependencies resolved

## Usage
After uploading to ESP32-CAM:
1. Connect to WiFi network
2. Open web interface at device IP
3. Navigate to "WiFi Settings" section
4. View new protocol, speed, and bandwidth information
